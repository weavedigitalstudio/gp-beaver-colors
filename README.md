# GeneratePress Beave Builder Color Palettes

A custom plugin to add Beaver Builder color compatibility for the GeneratePress Global Color Palettes.
This is needed is you do not use the the WP Global Inline block styles.

It adds the correct block editor prefix '--wp--preset--color--' to the GeneratePress Global Colors so they are usable in Beaver Builder.

If you have removed the Global Inline styles from WordPress as you are not using a FSE (or a Block theme) you can use this plugin which adds the correct css varibale prefix to the Generate Press theme Global Colours in order for them to be picked up and to work with Beave Builder.

You do not need to set a Global Colour Palette in Beaver Builder also.

We remove the Global Inline styles for performance reason as we do not currently use them.
